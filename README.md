Lobola is property in cash or kind, which a prospective husband or head of his family undertakes to give to the head of a prospective wifeâ€™s family in consideration of a customary marriage.[1] Historically, this property was in cattle, but over time it has moved to being mostly in cash. Some people still practice the tradition of offering cattle, or even a combination of cattle and money.
